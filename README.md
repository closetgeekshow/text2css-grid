# text2css-grid
Generate CSS Grid Layout From PlainÂ Text Layout

## Fork Details
This is a fork of the original text2css-grid project. I think it's a great idea, but I wanted to make it a bit more understandable to my dumb brain and to add the ability to ascribe other properties and metadata to the boxes. 

It's part of my resarch into text-based diagramming and annotation techniques. Along with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) (particularly, the [Salt (Wireframe) syntax](https://plantuml.com/salt)) and [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/). 
), I think it's a great way to quickly sketch out wireframes without having to worry too much about the details. 

I'll admit I'm getting a lot of help from things like [Sourceforge Cody](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cody/) and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to achieve this.

## What's the goal?
I want to be able to sketch out notes in a text file and have it turn into prototypes or being able to be indexed in some fashion. If I can indicate layout primitives, or what controls go in a box that would be great. 

If I could also sketch out UIs in Salt or something similar (haven't found many good options for that yet) and combine it with the ASCII art layout thing. Then maybe I can make notes about an idea and have it turn into a wireframe sketch as I do.
